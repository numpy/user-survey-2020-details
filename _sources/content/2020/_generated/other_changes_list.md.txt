|Tutorials to improve performance without being an expert C or Fortran user. (Original in Spanish: Tutoriales para mejorar rendimiento sin ser usuario experto de C o Fortran.)|
|Although this is probably not too feasible, some limited ability to write "non-vectorised" multi-line maths/logic in simple loop-like structures (e.g. where perhaps tools like Numba might be overkill) and have it optimise the loop overhead (e.g. like some sort of local static typing) would be quite nice to see.|
|make loadtxt and savetxt more symmetrical and flexible|
|Automatic differentiation|
|Cython interaction is sometimes awkward (should I use Cython memoryviews or an ndarray?)|
|Tighter integration / support for numpy extensions like numba and cupy|
|From my point of view, numpy is most important as the base on which other scientific packages are built. The ones I use most are scipy.stats, astropy, and pandas. In that respect, I don’t see a need for significant changes in numoy|
|More speed ;)|
|Implicit support for specialized compute hardware (GPU)|
|A syntax more similar to that of R. (Original in Portuguese: Uma sintaxe mais similar a do R.)|
|Nothing: NumPy is excellent!|
|Document the errors|
|clearer documentation of every array manipulations|

|Adding autodiff, enabling named tensor axes (even if not "labelled", at least "named", to keep tensor dimensions' semantic meaning straight)|
|GPU support|
|Modern, more readable Sphinx theme. Deprecate unused or out of scope parts of the library.|
|I know you'll never do it, but the matmul operator is nearly useless. I have no control as to whether the user passes in a matrix or scalar, and in many instances both are entire correctly. So my code is still only using dot. I've read the arguments of 'only one way' and it's bogus. We don't have different operators to add int int vs float float, nor should we. So I have dot(F, P).dot(Q) everywhere instead of F@P@Q. It is so hard to read, and prone to error (F.dot(P) can fail if F is not a matrix). I initially went through a bunch of code replacing dot with @ but had to get rid of them all because I was getting endless exceptions. This is sw to do math - please let us express it in a reasonable manner! And make these comment boxes bigger! A one line box to enter a 'significant' change?|
|Automatic differentiation|
|More understanding of low level functions|
|Performance tests related to the different ways of programming with Numpy. (Original in Spanish: Pruebas de rendimiento relacionadas con las distintas formas de programar con Numpy.)|

|Emphasize on performance! And keep up good work - Numpy is great.|
|Interfaces a otros lenguajes|
|Combine methods/algorithms under single module to reduce imports (and googling).|
|It occasionally breaks or installs incorrectly on windows and with VSCode. Numpy experts might do more to smooth over this issue|
|Cleaner documentation with more cross linking|
|Progress the masked array topic would be great, there were ideas on a replacement, not sure what the solution is but a more versatile and efficient solution would be awesome.|
|GPU computing|
|More cohesion? - "one right way to do things" (scalars), actually removing np.matrix, better support for @, etc.|
|Make the mean and standard deviation functions account for nan values like the nanmean functions.|
