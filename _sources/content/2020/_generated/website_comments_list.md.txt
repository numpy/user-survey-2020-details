|fonts are too small on Firefox, lot of white space.|
|ReadTheDocs, but not with the default skin|
|The new design at numpy.org looks great so just carry on with that really.  I think in general, numpy doesn't really get the credit it deserves due it being such a core part of so many other scientific libraries so I like the case studies|
|NEP 28 — numpy.org website redesign :)|
|Last time I checked the front page it was impossible to get to the actual documentation. But it has changed since I last checked.|
|General improvement of the readability of the Numpy Reference, e.g. something like the new Pandas reference.|
|Material UI, easier search, hide old versions from google|
|- search results on documentation are unreliable / do not give what I was looking for - merge scipy and numpy documentation or make it clearer wich one I need for what - add more stuff here: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/howtos_index.html|
|More intuitive directory. More extensive examples per function, trying to make use of most of the arguments of the function. I think the new Pandas web looks pretty good and would be a good match of style for numpy too, but in any case content is a priority over style.|
|Use animations to explain what some commands do, such as handling arrays. (Original in Spanish: Usar animaciones para explicar que hacen algunos comandos, como por ejemplo el manejo de los array.)|
|Make the documentation part of the website look more modern. Have better, more readable fonts and better organizational structure. Make it less white. It hurts the eyes.|
|make it easier to keep an overview of different sections and navigate between them (maybe by enlarging the top bar).|
|Please enhance the tutorials. (Original in Japanese: チュートリアルを充実させてほしい.)|
|Fewer clicks to reach the documentation.|
|While the internet has a lot of other sources for looking up key features/implementation details/tutorials on the how and why NumPy does things, as a fairly fundamental package (especially in the scientific community!) it would be very helpful to have a single centralised source of information (+ a "cookbook" of sorts for useful non-one-liners) with a user friendly way of navigating to relevant information (as per NEP 28). This would be especially useful for newer users (or even newcomers to Python!), and I think that a strong website would help showcase the functionality and utility befitting such a fundamentally useful tool!|
|Site map and navigation aids|
|Not sure, but I really like the new changes :)|
|Higher priority on examples over strict API documentation.|
|Make documentation site redesign otherwise I can not miss feeling that it is very old tools that it is abandoned. Make proper search. Currently, it shows titles only|
|Updated documentation page that's easier to navigate. For example: a table of contents that remains visible while you scroll down the page.|
|Integrate online documentation into new website branding better.|
|I really like that numpy switched into its own domain recently, and the new homepage.  The documentation doesn't seem to fit with the new website though: a consistent theme would be really nice.  Getting started with numpy took me a long time originally (mostly since I didn't have a strong background in linear algebra, the whole point of a multidimensional array didn't click with me immediately).|
|nice clear examples and guides|
|The search function could use improvement; when searching for functions (ie np.repeat) as "repeat" it'll return the named function later than expected; additionally it will return various results above it which can be confusing to new users.|
|A website which has modern look and feel works on all screen sizes.|
|New front page numpy.org looks great!|
|Maybe making it more modern will attract interest. Make it easier to find docs, then always relying on Google.|
|API documentation   Getting started with numpys more advanced features  Common performance pitfalls section, with examples |
|The new front page looks fantastic. The "documentation" and "learn" sections provide so many different places to start learning that I'm not sure where to direct new Python users. I understand this is being improved under NEP 44.|
|Better search, easier navigation into submodules|
|add best practice and/or performance comparison of optimal/sub-optimal ways to use each functions|
|The recent redesign is very good, but it has to be polished.|
|When you search “numpy” on google.co.jp, please do something that the official page comes up high in search results. (Original in Japanese: 日本語でnumpyとGoogle検索をしたとき、公式ページが検索結果上位に来ない点をどうにかしてほしい。)|
|There are no specific suggestions, but at the moment I’m having difficulty finding the explanation of the function I am looking for. (Original in Japanese: 具体的な案はないが、現状では探している機能の説明にアクセスしづらいと感じている.)|
|A lot of documentation with a lot of tutorials would be good. (Original in Japanese: チュートリアルが豊富なドキュメントが多いと良い.)|
|I think it would be good to be able to browse the website in multiple languages. (Original in Japanese: 多言語でのウェブサイト閲覧が可能にするのが良いと思います。)|
|Clone tensorflow, or similar.|
|More examples / Ensure examples demonstrate breadth of features / Possible code execution on site?|
|More documentation.|
|The numpy documentation looks dull and boring. It needs a fresh look.|
