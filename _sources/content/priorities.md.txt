We asked survey respondents to share their priorities for NumPy to get a sense
of the needs/desires of the NumPy community.
Users were asked to rank the following categories in order of priority:

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
tags: [hide-input]
---
for category in sorted(column_names[:-1]):
    print(f" - {category.replace('_', ' ').capitalize()}")
```

A write-in category (`Other`) was also included so that participants could
share priorities beyond those listed above.

## Overview

Of the {glue:text}`num_respondents` survey participants,
{glue:text}`num_prioritizers` shared their priorities for NumPy moving forward.

To get a sense of the overall relative "importance" of each of the categories,
the following figure summarizes the score for each category as determined by
the [Borda counting procedure for ranked-choice voting][borda-wiki].

[borda-wiki]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count

# Unstructured, numerical data
raw = data.view(np.dtype('U1')).reshape(-1, len(column_names)).astype(int)
borda = len(column_names) + 1 - raw
relative_score = np.sum(borda, axis=0)
relative_score = 100 * relative_score / relative_score.sum()
# Prettify labels for plotting
labels = np.array([l.replace('_', ' ').capitalize() for l in column_names])
I = np.argsort(relative_score)
labels, relative_score = labels[I], relative_score[I]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
ax.barh(np.arange(len(relative_score)), relative_score, tick_label=labels)
ax.set_xlabel('Relative Borda score (%)')
fig.tight_layout()
```

In {ref}`sec:priorities` we will take a closer look at how things are
prioritized.

## Top Priorities

The following figure shows the breakdown of the top priority items.

```{code-cell} ipython3

tags: [hide-input]

# Prettify labels for plotting
labels = np.array([l.replace('_', ' ').capitalize() for l in column_names])
# Collate top-priority data
cnts = np.sum(raw == 1, axis=0)
I = np.argsort(cnts)
labels, cnts = labels[I], cnts[I]

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
ax.barh(np.arange(cnts.shape[0]), 100 * cnts / cnts.sum(), tick_label=labels)
ax.set_title('Distribution of Top Priority')
ax.set_xlabel('Percent of Responses')
fig.tight_layout()
```

### Details

We asked respondents who shared their priorities to provide specifics on their
top two priorities.
For example, if a user ranked "Performance" as a top priority, they were asked
to share any specific thoughts on how performance could be improved.
The responses for each of the categories are provided below.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
tags: [hide-input]
---
categories = {
    "docs", "newfeatures", "other", "packaging", "performance", "reliability",
    "website",
}

# Load the text responses for each category
response_dict = {}
for category in categories:
    responses = np.loadtxt(
        f"data/{category}_comments_master.tsv", delimiter='\t', skiprows=1,
        usecols=0, dtype='U', comments=None
    )
    responses = responses[responses != '']
    response_dict[category] = responses

# Generate nicely-formatted lists
for category, responses in response_dict.items():
    gen_mdlist(responses, f"{category}_comments_list.md")

# Register number of responses in each category
for k, v in response_dict.items():
    glue(f"num_{k}_comments", v.shape[0], display=False)
```

% TODO: This would be much more convenient if the MD tables could be included
% programmatically. For example, if myst-nb adds support for the 
% IPython.display Markdown() function

#### Documentation

## Summary

The following figure shows the relative frequency of selection for each of
the listed categories[^other] at each priority level.

```{code-cell} ipython3
---
tags: [hide-input]
---
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(12, 8))

for i, ax in enumerate(axes.ravel()):
    priority_level = i + 1
    cnts = np.sum(raw == priority_level, axis=0)[I]
    ax.barh(np.arange(cnts.shape[0]), 100 * cnts / cnts.sum(), tick_label=labels)
    ax.set_title(f"Priority: {priority_level}")
fig.tight_layout()
```

[^other]: Excluding `Other`, which was an optional category and therefore
          constitutes the majority of the "lowest-priority".
