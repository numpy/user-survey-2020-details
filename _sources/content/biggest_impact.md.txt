To conclude the survey, we asked participants to share their thoughts on what
changes to NumPy would have the most significant impact for them as users.

## Biggest Impact

We asked survey participants the following question:

  > What single immediate change to NumPy would bring the most value to
  > you as a NumPy user?

The responses of the {glue:text}`num_biggest_impact` survey participants who
answered this question are listed below.

```

## Other Significant Changes

Finally, we asked participants to share any other changes that would 
significantly improve NumPy.
The responses of the {glue:text}`num_other` participants who answered this
question are listed below.

```{code-cell} ipython3

gen_mdlist(other_changes, "other_changes_list.md")
