</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Some documentation is little short for beginners and it took some time to understand the usage of certain methods, maybe a documentation with a âbeginners modeâ containing easier description and lots of examples could help, however most of the times I find hints on stackoverflow.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Canât find a comprehensive list of all the functions and how their parameters work. The dir() function spews out hundreds of functions. Should be a PDF or website that documents each function with its parameters. Also group them by functionality. Ideally have examples. The pandas docs seem much better.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>code examples (also graphical), document every use case</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>The documentation on dtype casting is incomplete and largely missing from the user guide.  It would make NumPy more newcomer friendly to have the casting rules (including for assignments to an ndarray) explained clearly.  Examples of some of the commonly unexpected casting behaviors should be included too.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>The user guide is missing examples of ndarrays with 0 in their shape.  These show up quite a bit (at least in my experience), and broadcasting with them should be explained more clearly to newcomers.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>There are a lot of more-or-less redundant functions in NumPy.  A section of the documentation containing NumPy idioms (or even a âcookbookâ) would be helpful at clearing up things like when to use ravel vs. reshape(-1) vs. flatten().</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Provide a comprehensive how-to on using NumPy for linear algebra manipulations on ndarrays.  Itâs a little tricky to figure out the mappings from normal linear algebra notation to 1d and 2d ndarray operations (e.g., adding a newaxis to form the outer product of two vectors represented as 1d ndarrays).â</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>The documentation should be more detailed and well organized.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>When we look for information through a search engine we too often come across documents that do not correspond to the current version of Numpy; you would need a centralized doc corresponding to the most recent version (like what exists for Matlab for example). (This comment was submitted in French.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>More examples and section-wise documentation will help learners</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Write proper documentation that easy to read especially for students/beginners.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>More verbose with respect to examples and tutorials on top of the technicalities.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>NumPy would benefit from user guides, like scikit-learn has. Guides that explain how to use tools to accomplish a task (instead of just code documentation) would make NumPy more approachable and invite kn new users (or inspire old users to use features in new ways).</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>As pointed out recently, the âUser Guideâ portion is a bit of a hodgepodge of unstructured material while much of the real user documentation is in the âAPI Referenceâ, which is pretty well-structured but ends up trying to do multiple jobs at once.</p></td>
