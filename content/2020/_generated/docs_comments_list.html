<tr class="row-even"><td><p>The reference manual is too much programmation-oriented. For me there is a lack of a presentation which is more mathematically-oriented.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Better cross-linking and more links to Python and C-level source code</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Most functions have excellent documentation and I can tell that there’s a lot of attention given to docstrings. Some functions however lack a single application example. Sometimes I get a much quicker grasp on a function by just looking at the examples as opposed to reading through verbose descriptions of the numerous arguments. Especially in cases I don’t even end up using the function, it is much less frustrating when there are examples so that I immediately see that it is not what I’m looking for.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Tbh the documentation is already probably some of the best of any library I use but specifically it would be great if it was a little easier to get into the Numpy source code.  As it’s quite a large and mature project, it can be tricky to know where to start with it and how much of say the Python C-API it’s necessary to know about to feel comfortable.  It’s maybe too much work for someone to do but what I’ve found amazingly useful in the past are guides where someone builds up a ‘minimal version’ of a project so you can see the core of the library (like this fort SQLite https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/) - it’s something I thought about trying to do with Numpy at some point (just the core array structure, no linear algebra etc)</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Providing more stand alone examples of common tasks. Often I read docs and find an example of what I am trying to do, but then need to read several other layers of docs to understand the example.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>yes, i think documentation plays a key role in sowing a seed inside learner and it would be really great if a user can find a better way in understanding the analogies and codes comprehensively used in this library</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>I regularly work with structured arrays to read binary data dumps, and a 1:1 C-structure to structured array dtype would be very helpful.  I’m specifically thinking of how to translate a C union into a structured array.  Otherwise, python is gaining traction at my company, so documentation is the most important thing for us.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>See above. Documentation always helps, but numpys is pretty good anyway.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>It is good, but sometimes it can be hard to find functions that I suspect that NumPy has. The doctrees have been greatly improved but drilling down to the functions can be confusing.   Additionally, lots of functions have good details if you are an expert in the topic but are not so good if you are not. A good example is the filter design functions. scipy.signal.butter has an argument called “analog” it’s description is unhelpfully “When True, return an analog filter, otherwise a digital filter is returned.” What is the difference? why might I care?  The code samples for scipy.signal.butter are another good example, they use the library very differently than I might when I use it. (this is more typical: https://stackoverflow.com/a/12233959/4492611)  This is not to say that the docs are not excellent, they are just the main way that I interact with NumPy and the topic I care the most about.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>* giving more examples for different situations instead of making one for multiple methods. * also, plus one weird example might widen people’s horizon</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>improve the structured overview so that idiots like me don’t try to program stuff that is just a small subset of np.einsum</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>The NumPy library is very large, and because of fairly strict backward-compatibility guarantees, there are many different ways to achieve a particular task.  I think that the documentation could be improved with an informal style guide that helps new and old users sort out what the ‘modern’ NumPy way is.  An alternative (if a style guide would be too contentious) is to provide a collection of examples of ‘modern’ NumPy being used to accomplish common tasks and avoid gotchas.  For example, a linear algebra collection might include examples of the use of 1d/2d ndarrays as opposed to the outdated matrix type, the use of &#64; as opposed to np.dot, etc.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Taking scikit-learn as an example, maybe more tutorials on how to do things and documentation explaining the theory and concepts behind the functions and implementations.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>More examples in the documentation would be awesome, sometimes I found myself using functions that solved my problems but the utility of it did not came from documentation, but from a colleague showing it to me</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>The NumPy documentation is already excellent. The only problem I have is that it sometimes feels hard to figure out all the features that exist. I am not sure how to overcome this exactly. Maybe some more use-cases where a user is guided through a complete problem set is helpful (I know that this also already exist, maybe more of that for different use cases).</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>I will first say that in my view numpy is a gold standard in self-generated documentation and everyone involved in the project should be very proud of the state of the documentation. I have found some cases where more examples would be useful. I have a background in numerical physics and I find some of the documentation of complex numerical algorithms to be lacking, although the only examples I can think of now are in scipy. Where a complex numerical algorithm is concerned I don’t think it is enough to document the API. There are always limitations and edge cases where the algorithm will not perform well, or could even return incorrect results. The documentation could do more on this front.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>More examples and recommendations, I would copy pandas. (Original in Spanish: Más ejemplos y recomendaciones, copiaria a pandas.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Organising documentation will surely help a lot. Good examples are Docker or Tensorflow documentation.   Another improvement is to add more guides for developers that are interested in contributing to NumPy.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Certain scientific doc’s are ok, but not always referencing good papers/sites.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>NumPy, to me, had and sometimes has a steep cliff: I can easily understand the basic use of a function, but actually wrapping my head around how to use the function on a dataset in a useful way in a complex function can be difficult. I don’t think there’s necessarily an easy solution for this, but more varied examples in documentation could help.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>inclusion of in depth examples</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>- documentation between numpy and scipy (and different versions) is a bit confusing sometimes - documentation in some cases is just not enough to understand what a function does - sometimes I’m not sure if I just cannot find the correct method I am looking for or if it does not exist entirely</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>I think adding some high-level tutorials, especially for the more obscure parts of NumPy: - Stride tricks - Structured Arrays and complicated dtypes - Buffer protocol integration (especially w/ 3rd party libraries or custom C/C++ codebases) - Docs on how to get better performance (w/ pointers to 3rd party libraries like Cython or Numba)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>more documentation in Spanish. (Original in Spanish: mas documentacion en español.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Expand the connection between current documentation and basic mathematical models. Currently in many sections of the documentation there is an extract of the concepts used (as in fft) but it would be nice to have the reverse process: A documentation that from the mathematical models can reach the related numpy functions. (Original in Spanish: Ampliar la conexión entre la documentación actual y los modelos matemáticos de base.Actualmente en muchas secciones de la documentación hay un extracto de los conceptos usados (como en fft) pero estaría bien tener el proceso inverso: Una documentación que desde los modelos matemáticos pueda llegar a las funciones de numpy relacionadas.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>I am sometimes confused over the exact working of the more seldomly used arguments of a function even after reading the docs. More examples and longer explanations would help. Also, numpy has many functionalities and I often find it hard to identify what I need for a certain problem.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Add more examples on the use of numpy in specific areas (differential equations in physics, mathematical models of biological systems, etc). (Original in Spanish: Agregar más ejemplos sobre el uso de numpy en áreas específicas (ecuaciones diferenciales en física, modelos matemáticos de sistemas biológicos, etc).)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Documentation of all the algorithms/methods should have appropriate citations and a variety of examples (many of them do already, but this can still be improved)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Videotutorials</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Please add more step-by-step tutorials (and direct links to them from official documentation). Examples are the great way to understand some new concepts</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Sometimes it is difficult to find the documentation and sometimes you will find documentation of functions from previous versions that are not known to be older, so it would be good to specify which functions are current and which are not. Also sometimes it is difficult to know how to search certain functions. (Original in Spanish: A veces es difícil encontar la documentación y a veces se encuentra documentación de funciones de versiones anteriores que no se sabe que son anteriores, por lo que sería bueno especificar cuáles funciones son actuales y cuáles no. También a veces es difícil saber como buscar ciertas funciones.)</p></td>

While the documentation is fine to provide a simple understanding, to get a more complete understanding I read full implementations from dask or cupy.  Also some less ``mainstream’’ interfaces sometimes lack examples that would greatly facilitate the meaning of options. A recent example that comes to mind is lgmres (can’t think of a numpy right in this instance).</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Although not really anyone’s fault, old deprecated commands (especially on the SciPy documentation) are everywhere. Streamlining the numpy.random documentation to clarify trade-offs would be helpful. I also think that many beginner’s are unaware of a lot of the many useful commands, so having some easy way to find new commands (like numpy.roll) would be great. There have been many times that I have written code one way, then learned of a superior (cleaner / more performant) way a year later. I think the numpy.where command is a good example.</p></td>

Some examples on reference pages are great, but some pages are missing them. Also, it would be excellent if the existing NumPy tutorials could be linked (as permalinks / versions) from the documentation when possible.  I’m thinking MATLAB-level documentation quality (which TBH is a high bar!).</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>As someone who has been introducing peers to using Python as a scientific tool, questions about NumPy are often raised (e.g. how to do particular things, “gotchas” when implementing specific functions, or more general interest in a “cookbook” of various minimal working examples of it being used). While the NumPy documentation (specifically, that available through the manual) goes some way to addressing this (especially as a quick reference for function arguments/outputs/references!), there is always room for improvement:  One particular aspect of this could be in the examples provided for “less trivial” examples where users may trip up on certain details in the implementation.  Another possibility could be adding additional sections to the “Explanations” and “How Tos” pages to cover common Q&amp;As from e.g. Stack Overflow etc (although I see that this is only a fairly recent addition as per NEP 44, and look forward to seeing how it progresses!)</p></td>

When you find yourself looking for np.fft.rfft, it is not always clear what you want, and moving between the three is not always intuitive (I use the top banner to move up, moving down is a little awkward. Overall though, numpy documentation is light years ahead of a lot of projects that I have used.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>- Documentation can be hard to find. For instance, say I go to learn about vectorization. This page (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/) has at least six different links that one might follow to find relevant documentation. Picking one, Tutorials (https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/tutorials_index.html), gives another set of links with no hint as to their contents. Finally, I have to guess that my topic would be considered “NumPy Basics”.

For instance, there are often several functions that are closely related and it’s hard to know which is the right one to use (it’s even harder to remember without needing to look it up each time!). Perhaps additional ways to group together pieces of documentation with a high-level commentary that says “here’s the one you should generally use unless you’re in this case…” would help.</p></td>

I really like the way new front page of the website highlights the main concepts of “vectorization, indexing, and broadcasting” and then lists some of the subpackages than NumPy offers. Perhaps that’s an outline that our intro docs could follow? I also wonder if multidimensional arrays should be introduced part-way through the new user tutorial so they can see some basic array operations sooner?</p></td>
