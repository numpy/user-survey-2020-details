(Original in Portuguese: Como NumPy é uma biblioteca de vasto uso tanto em âmbito profissional como acadêmico, é certo garantir alta performance e confiabilidade.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>I think reliability must be a top priority, no matter what. Being correct must be more important than any other aspect of NumPy. I believe that NumPy does a great job in this respect. I selected reliability as a top priority to keep seeing this.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>TBH I just gave this a very high priority because that is the aspect of the code I maintain I’ve been most focusing on lately, so I think it’s a crucial selling-point for any library. I don’t have a suggestion off the top of my head as far as numpy is concerned. I find most of the error messages I usually encounter are very helpful and I rarely find myself scratching my head over some error that looks unrelated to what I’m actually trying to do. That said, I do believe that issues related to user experience should be given a very high priority as numpy is the core package that everyone uses in my branch (astrophysics) and its behaviour inspires many lesser developers who need an example for excellence.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Improvements in the documentation so that people use the correct functions for their intended purpose.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>I would like to make Numpy as an easy to install and use in any machine without any hurdles. we can provide an API alternative to run Numpy server in cloud to access anywhere without installation. Include more features to assist developer needs.</p></td>

Keep in mind that very often the users of NumPy don’t have any background in software development.

Considerar que muchas veces gente que no viene del área de la computación entra al mundo de numpy.)</p></td>
</tr>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Improve the visibility of current tests and add test capacity to show numerical stability between versions. The main idea would be to have easy ways to trace from strange behavior in my user tests to tests of the numpy components that I am using so that I can quickly discriminate the source of the problem. (Original in Spanish: Mejorar la visibilidad de los test actuales y añadir capacidad de test para mostrar la estabilidad numérica entre versiones. La idea principal sería tener formas fáciles de trazar desde un comportamiento extraño en mis test de usuario a los tests de los componentes de numpy que estoy empleando para poder discriminar rápidamente el origen del problema.)</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Currently, I have no issues with the reliability of NumPy, but this feature should be one of the main targets in future development. Furthermore, the interoperation between NumPy and many other modules/packages like Pytorch and Tensorflow should be guaranteed.</p></td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>For scientific and academic work, reliability is key. When a calculation takes several hours/days to compute, NumPy has to work reliable.

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Truthfully, I am very happy with NumPy as it is right now. I have no complaints! But I couldn’t say that in the previous slide. So, if I had to pick a priority, reliability is in general my highest priority because we use NumPy in production.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Specifying the shape/strides of arrays can be very important for using NumPy arrays from C++ using pybind11. If you are not very careful about types, unnecessary copying occurs. Although NumPy usually allocates C-style arrays, having a guarantee ahead of time (when creating the first array) would avoid help avoid excessive memory usage.</p></td>

This might have been a documentation issue or a limitation in masked arrays so I didn’t report it as a bug although it might have been.</p></td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>Reliability (in the sense of presenting a long term stable API in particular) is something that needs to be improved in numpy.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>In my mind, reliability means decreasing the chance that unexpected errors or wrong results can occur due to e.g. rare data cases, or a user’s subtle misunderstanding of function semantics. I don’t consider myself knowledgeable enough on np’s internals or development to really suggest specific plans for how to improve reliability, but I imagine that better documentation can help prevent users’ from doing operations they don’t realize are “unsafe”. Also more built-in checking could be added, though of course this needs to be balanced against performance impact. As another enhancement that partly touches reliability, I would appreciate better support for missing data. This is a common cause of runtime errors that are not immediately noticed in development, both directly in my code and when passing data to other libraries. (I would especially appreciate missing data functionality that integrates well with pandas and similar parts of the ecosystem.)  Another very different idea would be to enhance support for static type checking, via offering a more official distribution of type annotations and eventually a full-featured type system such that checkers could enforce data types and shapes.</p></td>

<tr class="row-even"><td><p>Numpy is already pretty reliable :) I guess being as explicit as possible with error strings is always helpful. I also found that if i happen to be stuck with a numpy array with the object dtype (a large array was saved within a list of lists) then it can get pretty messy to go back to ndarray. I had to recursively call np.vstack on the sub-arrays, even though everything was a float.</p></td>
