# 2020 Survey Results

In 2020, the NumPy survey team in partnership with students and faculty
from a Masterâ€™s course in Survey Methodology jointly hosted by the
University of Michigan and the University of Maryland conducted the first
official NumPy community survey. Over 1,200 users from 75 countries
participated to help us map out a landscape of the NumPy community and
voiced their thoughts about the future development of the project.
