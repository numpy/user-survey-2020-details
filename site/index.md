## About

In mid-2020, the NumPy Survey Team in partnership with students and faculty
from a Masters course in Survey Methodology jointly hosted by the
University of Michigan and the Unverisity of Maryland conducted the first
official NumPy Community Survey.
We invited all NumPy stakeholders to share their experiences with NumPy, and
to voice their thoughts about the future of the project.
The results from this inaugural survey can be found
{doc}`here <content/2020/index>`.
